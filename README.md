# Problem Statement
To find out redundant ports on a given host/server in order to mitigate
an attack and identify network services running on a host.
# Detailed Workflow :
● We are using Sockets, Time and Thread libraries in python  
● We will implement python socket programming to scan the ports
that are active on the given host.  
● We will use a loop to scan the active ports on the host for the
specified port range given by the user.  
● If a user enters an URL we automatically convert it to its
respective IP address.  
● There are 2 scanning modes: Simple and Comprehensive, Simple Mode(1024 Ports),Comprehensive Mode(64000 Ports).
